# CryptocurrencyApp

This project is done with the help of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF33KmyprEQ&t=2s. 

It implements MVVM design pattern, SOLID principles and clean architecture. 

App uses Jetpack Compose (instead of XML) and Retrofit for interacting with API. 

I extend the app with additional functionalities:
- local caching with Room
- error handling, refreshing and loading
